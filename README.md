# Benefits for Disabled Veterans in Illinois (By VA Disability Rating)

Illinois offers a wide array of benefits, programs, and discounts to honorably discharged veterans with service-connected disabilities. Many benefits increase or kick in once you reach certain VA disability rating thresholds. Below is a comprehensive breakdown by VA disability rating – **0%, 10%, 30%, 50%, 80%, 90%, and 100%** – covering financial benefits, tax exemptions, education and training, health care, recreation, discounts, free services, and local programs (with a focus on the Scott Air Force Base region including St. Clair, Madison, Clinton, Monroe, and Washington counties). For each benefit, we note who qualifies, documentation needed, whether it’s federal, state, or local, and how to apply. *Remember:* Even at lower ratings you qualify for all benefits available to *higher* ratings up to your level (e.g. a veteran rated 50% gets everything at 0%, 10%, 30%, and 50%). Always have proof of your veteran status and VA disability percentage (e.g. VA award letter or Veteran ID card) when applying for these benefits.

## 0% Disability (Service-Connected with 0% Rating)

Even with a 0% VA disability rating (meaning your condition is service-connected but not yet compensable monthly), you become eligible for several important benefits and services:

* **VA Health Care Enrollment:** With any service-connected disability (even 0%), you can enroll in VA health care. You’ll be assigned a priority group based on disability and income. At 0% you typically fall into Priority Group 6 or 5 (if lower income). All treatment for your **service-connected condition** is provided **free of charge**. Treatment for other conditions may require a co-pay (depending on your income level), but having a service connection moves you ahead of purely non-service-connected veterans. *Documentation:* Your VA award letter showing service connection. *How to apply:* Enroll online at VA.gov or at any VA Medical Center; you’ll get a Veteran Health Identification Card (VHIC).

* **VA Commissary & Exchange Privileges:** Since 2020, veterans with *any* service-connected disability rating (0% or higher) have access to military commissaries, base exchanges, and morale, welfare & recreation (MWR) facilities. This means you *can shop tax-free* for groceries and goods on military bases (like the Scott AFB Exchange/Commissary) and use services like base recreational facilities. *Documentation:* Present your VHIC that displays “Service Connected” at the base gate (or enroll your REAL ID at the visitor center). *Where to apply:* The benefit is automatic with your VHIC; to get on base the first time, register at the visitor control center with your ID.

* **Federal Employment Preference (Hiring Points):** A service-connected disability, even 0%, entitles you to a **10-point preference** in federal hiring exams. (Veterans with disabilities qualify as “disabled veterans” for federal hiring; 0% is covered under the 10-point **XP** category.) This gives you a significant advantage when applying for federal jobs. *Documentation:* Standard Form SF-15 and your VA disability award letter. *Apply:* Through USAJOBS when seeking federal employment (claim veteran preference and submit documentation).

* **Home Loans – Funding Fee Exemption:** VA home loans are available to most veterans, but usually include a funding fee. If you have a service-connected disability, you are **exempt from the VA loan funding fee**. Note that the VA interprets this as being exempt if you’re **eligible to receive compensation** – typically this means you have a compensable rating. A 0% rating by itself might not waive the fee unless you have a pending increase. However, as soon as you have a 10%+ compensable rating (covered below), your funding fee is waived. *Documentation:* Your Certificate of Eligibility for VA loan will indicate funding fee exempt status if VA has you on record with a compensable disability. If not, lenders can submit your VA rating letter.

* **Illinois War Bonuses:** Illinois offers one-time **bonus payments** for veterans who served during certain wartime periods or conflicts, regardless of disability. Even at 0% (since this is for service, not disability), you may be eligible if you served in designated conflicts: e.g. \$100 for service during the **Global War on Terrorism** (with 30+ days foreign service after 9/11/2001), \$100 for **Persian Gulf War**, \$100 for **Vietnam War** service (or \$1,000 to surviving spouse if veteran died from Agent Orange exposure), \$100 for **Korean War**, and even bonuses per month of service in WWII. There’s also a \$50/month bonus for former POWs from Vietnam era. *Who qualifies:* Illinois residents (12+ months residency before service) with honorable discharge who served in those periods. *Documentation:* DD-214 and any medal citations (e.g. campaign medal) as required. *Where to apply:* **Illinois Department of Veterans’ Affairs (IDVA)** – you can **apply online** via the IDVA War Bonus application portal or visit a local Veterans Service Office for help.

* **Illinois Veterans’ Homes:** With any service connection (0%+), you are eligible to apply for admission to Illinois Veterans’ Homes (state-run nursing and domiciliary care homes) if you need long-term care. Disabled veterans get priority admission for any open beds. Illinois has homes in Anna, Quincy, LaSalle, Chicago, and Manteno. *Who qualifies:* Honorably discharged Illinois veterans; admission is based on level of care needed rather than rating, but service-connected disabled vets are given first preference. *Documentation:* DD-214, medical records, proof of Illinois residency. *Where to apply:* Through IDVA – complete the Veterans Home application (available on IDVA website or at a Veteran Service Office).

* **Illinois Veterans Grant (IVG) – Education:** The **IVG** covers **100% of tuition and mandatory fees** at any Illinois state-supported college, university, or community college for eligible veterans – this is **not** dependent on disability rating (0% qualifies as long as other criteria met). *Who qualifies:* Illinois residents who served at least one year of active duty (or served overseas in a hostile area), received an honorable discharge, and returned to Illinois within 6 months of discharge. There is no expiration on using IVG (unlike the GI Bill). *Documentation:* IVG application, DD-214. *Where to apply:* **Illinois Student Assistance Commission (ISAC)** – apply online through the ISAC student portal or through your college’s financial aid office. This can be used in addition to or after federal GI Bill benefits.

* **Other State Education Benefits:** Even at 0%, your family might benefit from certain programs:

  * **Children of Veterans Scholarship (University of Illinois):** Each county in Illinois can award one scholarship per year to the University of Illinois for a veteran’s child. Preference is given to children of **disabled veterans** or those deceased in service. This covers full tuition for four years at any U of I campus. Check with your county’s Veterans Assistance Commission or the University’s financial aid office for application details.
  * **Academic Credit for Military Training:** Illinois colleges award academic credit for corresponding military training and experience. This is not disability-related, but all veterans can benefit. Provide your Joint Services Transcript to your college; see the Illinois *Mil2Sec* or **Illinois Transfer Portal** for how credits apply.

* **Veterans’ Hiring & Training Programs:** Regardless of rating, you can access job counseling and placement programs. Illinois operates the **Illinois Hires Heroes Consortium** and **IDES Veteran Employment Services** to connect veterans with jobs. Additionally, as a veteran you may have certain state licensing requirements waived: for example, Illinois waives the college degree requirement when applying to be a state police officer, municipal police or firefighter if you have sufficient active duty service (education waiver for veterans). Many apprenticeships and trade unions in the Scott AFB area also have veteran hiring preferences or entry programs.

* **Legal Assistance:** Veterans of any rating can get **free legal help** for many civil issues. The **Illinois Armed Forces Legal Aid Network (IL-AFLAN)** is a statewide hotline and network of legal aid organizations for veterans. You or your family can call **855-452-3526 (IL-AFLAN)** to speak with an attorney about VA benefit appeals, discharge upgrades, housing, consumer issues, family law, and more. *Who qualifies:* All Illinois veterans, active-duty, Guard/Reserve, and immediate families. *Documentation:* Usually just proof of service (e.g. DD-214) if needed. *Where to apply:* Simply call the hotline; they will refer you to a partner legal aid office or clinic. (For example, in the metro-east area near Scott AFB, Land of Lincoln Legal Assistance Foundation is a partner that may handle cases).

* **Veteran Designation on Illinois Driver’s License/ID:** At any rating (or even with no disability), Illinois allows a “VETERAN” mark on your driver’s license or state ID. This can help you claim retail discounts or prove veteran status easily. *Documentation:* DD-214 showing honorable discharge. *Where to apply:* Illinois Secretary of State Driver Services facility – ask for the veteran designation when getting or renewing your license/ID.

* **Retail and Business Discounts:** Many private businesses give year-round veteran discounts once you show proof of veteran status (ID with Veteran designation, VA card, etc.). For example, home improvement retailers **Home Depot** and **Lowe’s** offer a **10% military/veteran discount** on purchases year-round for veterans (you register online or via their app with proof of service). Large chains (Academy Sports, Foot Locker, etc.) often have similar 10–15% discounts. In the Scott AFB region, numerous local businesses also offer veteran deals – e.g. Lion’s Choice restaurant in the metro-east gives veterans **20% off daily** with ID, Denny’s in Glen Carbon offers **20% off on Thursdays** for veterans, and many others (cafes, shops) give \~10% off. Always ask if a military or veteran discount is available. *Documentation:* Military ID, VA VHIC, or Illinois DL with “Veteran” designation typically.

* **Recreation – Hunting & Fishing:** Illinois waives hunting and fishing license fees for disabled veterans with at least a 10% rating (see next section), but even a 0% veteran (if not receiving compensation) might not meet that threshold. However, **all Illinois veterans** returning from active duty are eligible for free fishing, hunting, and camping for a period of time under the **Returning Veterans Outdoor program** (for each year of service, up to two years post-discharge). Additionally, all veterans (regardless of disability) can get a free basic hunting license in Illinois *after* completing a hunter safety course – the state has had specials during Veterans Day, etc. Check with the Illinois DNR for any current programs.

* **State Parks Admission:** Illinois generally does not charge an entrance fee to state parks for anyone. However, camping fees and other usage fees can apply (see 10% and 100% sections for disability-based camping discounts).

* **Veterans Assistance Commissions (VACs):** Each of the counties around Scott AFB – **St. Clair, Madison, Clinton, Monroe, Washington** – has a VAC or veteran service office that provides help **regardless of disability percentage**. They can assist you in filing VA claims and also provide **temporary emergency financial assistance** if you are a veteran in need (for example, help with rent, utilities, food, or even burial costs for a veteran). For instance, the St. Clair County VAC (Belleville) and Madison County VAC (Edwardsville) have small grant programs for indigent veterans. *Documentation:* Proof of veteran status, residency in the county, and proof of need (for financial aid). *Where to apply:* Contact your county’s VAC directly (look up “\[County Name] Veterans Assistance Commission”). E.g., St. Clair County VAC is at 19 Public Square, Suite 300, Belleville (Phone: 618-277-0040), and Madison County VAC is at 157 N. Main St. Edwardsville (Phone: 618-296-4554). These offices can also help you apply for the state and federal benefits listed in this guide.

* **Illinois Warrior Assistance Program:** This is a free statewide helpline and resource for Illinois veterans (any disability) for mental health support, PTSD, or transition assistance. It’s a 24/7 confidential line. *Contact:* 1-866-554-IWAP (or via **Illinois Joining Forces** network). They provide referrals for counseling (independent of the VA) and can help coordinate care for issues like traumatic brain injury or post-traumatic stress.

* **Burial Benefits:** All veterans with any VA-recognized service connection qualify for certain burial benefits. You can be buried in a **VA national cemetery** at no cost for the grave, marker, and opening/closing. The closest national cemetery to the Scott AFB area is **Jefferson Barracks National Cemetery** in St. Louis (just across the river), or Alton National Cemetery (if eligible) and Camp Butler National Cemetery in Illinois. Your spouse and dependent children are also eligible for burial in national cemeteries. Additionally, if you die of a service-connected condition (even if rated 0% but the cause of death is service-related), VA will pay a burial allowance up to \$2,000. If you were in receipt of VA compensation (which 0% is not), a smaller burial allowance for non-service death may be available (around \$300 for burial and \$807 plot allowance, these amounts adjust). *Documentation:* DD-214 for cemetery eligibility; VA Form 21P-530 for burial allowance, plus death certificate and proof of service-connection or compensation status. *Where to apply:* Through any VA regional office or with the help of a VAC/VSO. For *county-specific help:* Some counties (like St. Clair County’s VAC) will provide a stipend or reimbursement toward burial or cremation of indigent veterans as well.

In summary, a 0% rating still opens many doors: you can access VA healthcare for your condition, shop on base, get hiring preferences, use state education benefits, and tap into various state programs and local resources. It’s important to **get a Veteran ID (either a state ID or VA VHIC)** and keep your **VA award letter** handy, as these documents will be your proof when applying for many of the benefits.

## 10% Disability Rating

At **10% service-connected disability**, you begin receiving VA disability **compensation payments** (about \$165 per month at 10% in 2025, increasing with COLA annually). This rating unlocks additional benefits or improved versions of those available at 0%. **All benefits listed for 0% also apply to 10% (and above)**, plus the following:

* **VA Disability Compensation:** First and foremost, a 10% rating means VA will pay you a monthly tax-free benefit. While 0% had no monthly payment, 10% (in 2025) is around \$165/month for a single veteran (higher if you have dependents at 30%+ ratings). Payments come on the first of each month (for the prior month) via direct deposit. *How to apply:* You would have already filed a VA claim to get your rating – if not, apply through VA.gov or with a VSO.

* **Increased Federal Hiring Preference:** At 10%, you continue to receive the **10-point hiring preference** in federal jobs (now classified under “CP – compensable preference” since you are receiving compensation). The advantage is the same 10 points, but having a compensable rating can give you additional opportunities like special noncompetitive hiring authorities for 30%+ (covered in 30% section).

* **VA Health Care Priority Upgrade:** Veterans with a compensable disability (10% or higher) are typically placed in **Priority Group 3** for VA health care, which may reduce your copays. All care for your service-connected disabilities is free, and **some** veterans with 10%–20% may even have **no medication copays for service-connected conditions and a lower cap on other copays**. (Full copay-free coverage of all care comes at 50%, see below.) Regardless, ensure you inform the VA you are now compensated so they update your priority group. *Documentation:* VA rating letter is usually automatically in their system, but bring a copy to your VA medical center eligibility office if needed.

* **VA Home Loan Funding Fee Waiver:** Once you are **receiving compensation** (10%+), you are officially exempt from the VA funding fee on VA home loans. This can save you thousands on a home purchase or refinance. *How to utilize:* When applying for a VA-backed mortgage, indicate that you have a service-connected rating. The Certificate of Eligibility or VA system should show you are funding-fee exempt due to receiving disability comp. (If the loan closes before VA updates your status, you can get a refund with proof of your rating.)

* **Illinois Disabled Veteran Hunting & Fishing License Exemption:** At **10% or higher** service-connected disability, Illinois waives *all fees* for hunting and fishing licenses, and even the State Habitat Stamp, for life. You do **not** need to purchase an annual license as a disabled veteran. Instead, you must obtain a *Veteran’s Disability ID card* from IDVA. This wallet card will indicate you have ≥10% service-connected disability and, when shown to a game warden, serves as your fishing/hunting license. *Who qualifies:* Illinois resident or non-resident veterans with ≥10% VA disability. (Non-residents get the same benefit in Illinois.) *Documentation:* VA award letter showing at least 10% rating. *Where to apply:* Through your **local Illinois Department of Veterans’ Affairs service office** – they will issue the Veteran Disability Card (sometimes called the “Military Combination Hunting/Fishing Privilege Card”). You can also contact the IL Dept. of Natural Resources; however, IDNR will refer you to IDVA for the card. Once you have the card, you simply carry it while fishing or hunting. (Note: This covers license fees; you still must apply for any deer/turkey *permits* or lottery tags and follow hunting regulations. Also, this exemption extends to the fee for the Habitat Stamp as well.)

* **State Park Camping Discount:** With a disabled ID card (class 2 or 2A disability, which corresponds to a service-connected disability in Illinois’ system), you are eligible for camping discounts at Illinois state parks. At 10% you qualify for these. Practically, Illinois offers **50% off camping fees Monday–Thursday** at many campgrounds for those with a Class 2 disability card, and charges the **full fee on weekends** (for Class A sites). However, for more primitive sites (Class C or D without utilities), *no camping fee* is charged any day for disabled veterans with the card. In short, as a 10%+ disabled vet you can camp for free in basic sites or half-price in sites with electricity hookups during weekdays. *Documentation:* The same Illinois Disabled Veteran card used for hunting/fishing. Show it when registering for camping or making reservations. *Where to apply:* (Card as above; camping itself is through the park or ReserveAmerica system, indicating disability status.)

* **Transportation Discounts:** Many transit systems offer fare discounts to disabled individuals and veterans:

  * **St. Louis Metro:** The MetroLink light rail and MetroBus in St. Clair and Madison counties participate in Illinois’ Benefit Access Program (for seniors and persons with disabilities). As a disabled veteran, you can apply to the **Benefit Access Program (BAP)** if you meet income criteria (for a single person, income <\$33,562 in 2025) – this program gives **free transit rides** on MetroLink and MetroBus in Illinois, and half-fare in Missouri. Alternatively, even without BAP, you can get a reduced-fare disability ID for Metro by applying through Metro’s ADA Services with proof of disability. Also, note that many transit agencies (including CTA in Chicago) have special programs for disabled veterans (CTA offers a **Military Service Pass** for free rides to vets with service-connected disabilities). While the St. Louis Metro doesn’t have a specific “veteran pass,” your VA disability can qualify you for their reduced fare program. *Documentation:* Benefit Access application (if applying) requires proof of disability (usually your VA award letter) and income. For reduced fare ID, use your VA letter or have a doctor certify disability. *Where to apply:* Illinois Benefit Access Program – apply online via Illinois Department on Aging’s website. For Metro St. Louis reduced fare ID – through Metro’s Transit Access Center (St. Louis) or St. Clair County Transit District for Illinois-side passes.

  * **Vehicle Registration (License Plates):** While the big fee waiver comes at 50% rating (see below), even at 10% you can request a **Disabled Veteran** license plate in Illinois (this plate has the letters “DV”). However, unless you are 50%+, you must pay the standard registration fee. The DV plate by itself (if not 50%+) grants no special parking unless you also qualify for a disability parking placard. If your disability involves loss of use of an limb or other qualifying mobility impairment, you can get the **International Symbol of Access** on your DV plate or a separate disability parking placard from the Secretary of State. *Who qualifies:* Any honorably discharged veteran with a service-connected disability can get a DV plate (you’ll need to show VA documentation). *Where to apply:* Illinois Secretary of State (DMV) – submit Form VSD 295 along with a VA disability certification.

* **Small Business and Tax Benefits:** With a 10% rating, if you start a business, you may qualify for Illinois’s **VOSB/SDVOSB** (Veteran-Owned Small Business / Service-Disabled VOSB) certification which can give state contracting preferences. A 10% SC vet would count as a Service-Disabled Veteran for state procurement purposes. Additionally, Illinois does not tax VA disability compensation or military pension, so your comp remains tax-free at the state level. There aren’t specific state income tax breaks at 10% beyond that.

* **Vocational Rehabilitation & Employment (VR\&E):** Also known as Chapter 31 or the Veteran Readiness and Employment program, VR\&E becomes a key benefit once you have a compensable disability. If you have an employment handicap due to your service-connected condition, you may be eligible for this program, which can pay for tuition, vocational training, career counseling, and other services to help you find suitable employment. *Who qualifies:* Veterans with a **10% or greater** service-connected rating **with an employment handicap**, or **20% or greater** with any employment impediment qualify. In practice, 10% cases require the VA to find a “serious” employment handicap. It’s often easier to qualify at 20%, but it’s possible at 10. *What it offers:* A personalized rehabilitation plan which may include college tuition (if your GI Bill is exhausted or not suitable), vocational training programs, apprenticeships, or other employment services. *Where to apply:* Through VA.gov (apply for VR\&E) or with a VA Voc Rehab counselor at the St. Louis Regional Office. If you’re near Scott AFB, the St. Louis VA Regional Office (downtown St. Louis) handles VR\&E; they also have satellite hours at Scott AFB’s Airman & Family Readiness Center occasionally. Documentation needed is your VA rating and an application (VA Form 28-1900).

* **Dependent Benefits:** At 10% you do *not* yet receive additional compensation for dependents – that starts at 30%. However, you should be aware of other dependent benefits that kick in at higher ratings (outlined below at 100% for things like CHAMPVA and DEA). At 10%, one thing to note: if you have minor children and you’re receiving any VA comp, your children might qualify for state or county veteran scholarships (as mentioned above) and possibly reduced fees at certain programs (for example, some park districts or YMCAs in the region have discounts for children of disabled veterans – these are local and need inquiry).

In summary, **10% is a significant milestone** – you start getting your VA check, you can get free hunting/fishing, you save money on home loans and possibly on taxes/fees, and you have solid footing to pursue further training or education with VR\&E. Be sure to update your status with any organizations (employers, schools, ID card offices) now that you are officially a “disabled veteran” receiving compensation.

## 30% Disability Rating

A **30% VA disability rating** brings additional state and federal benefits. This is a key threshold where many programs for “moderately disabled” veterans become available. You are entitled to everything in the 0% and 10% lists, **plus** the following enhancements:

* **Increased VA Compensation (With Dependents):** At 30%, VA compensation rises (approximately \$508 per month for a single veteran in 2025), and importantly VA will **add extra allowances for dependents**. If you have a spouse, children under 18, children 18-23 in college, or dependent parents, make sure to inform VA because you get additional monthly payment for each dependent at 30%+ ratings. *How to apply:* Submit VA Form 21-686c (Declaration of Dependents) on VA.gov or through a VSO so VA can pay the added amount.

* **Federal Employment – 30% Disabled Veteran Hiring:** At 30%, you remain eligible for the 10-point preference. Additionally, federal agencies can non-competitively appoint you to jobs under the **30% Disabled Veteran Appointment** authority. This means you can be hired without the full USAJOBS competitive process. *How to use:* Contact the HR departments of federal installations (such as Scott Air Force Base civilian personnel office or agencies like the VA, Defense, etc.) and mention you are eligible for a 30% Disabled Veteran non-competitive appointment (5 CFR 315.707 authority). You’ll need your VA award letter as proof. This can greatly expedite getting a federal job.

* **Illinois Disabled Veterans’ Property Tax Exemption:** **30% is the minimum rating to qualify** for the Illinois Disabled Veterans’ Standard Homestead Exemption on your primary residence. This is a **significant property tax savings**:

  * At **30% to 49%** VA disability, you get a **\$2,500 reduction** in the Equalized Assessed Value (EAV) of your home.
  * At **50% to 69%**, this increases to a **\$5,000 reduction** in EAV (we’ll cover 50% separately below).
  * At **70% or higher**, it becomes a total exemption (no property tax – covered under 70%/100% section).

  For a 30-49% disabled veteran in, say, St. Clair or Madison County, a \$2,500 EAV reduction might equate to a few hundred dollars off your annual tax bill (EAV is generally one-third of market value in IL, so roughly corresponds to \~\$7,500 market value reduction). *Who qualifies:* Illinois homeowners who are veterans with 30%+ service-connected disability. The home must be your primary residence and the total EAV of the property must be <\$250,000 (this covers most modest homes). *Documentation:* You need your VA award letter stating your current disability percentage. *Where/how to apply:* **Apply annually** through your **County Assessor’s Office** (or Supervisor of Assessments). Each county has a form for the “Disabled Veterans Homestead Exemption.” For example, St. Clair County and Madison County Assessors have downloadable forms. Include a copy of your VA rating decision letter and the form by the required deadline (often \~July of each year). Once approved the first time, you must re-file a short form or renewal letter each year to continue the exemption. **Important:** If you move or your percentage changes, inform the Assessor. (If your rating jumps into the next bracket, your exemption increases in the next tax year.)

* **VA Travel Reimbursement:** At 30% or higher, you become eligible for **VA travel pay** reimbursement for all your VA medical appointments, regardless of the condition being treated. VA will pay you mileage (currently \$0.415/mile) for travel to VA medical centers or clinics. (Below 30%, travel reimbursement is only if you are traveling for a *service-connected* condition or have low income or other qualifiers. But at 30%+, VA pays for travel for any care.) This is particularly useful if you have to travel from the Scott AFB area to the St. Louis VA Medical Center or Marion VA. They will also reimburse tolls and parking fees with receipts. *Documentation:* Once you’re enrolled and rated 30%, the VA system should mark you as travel-eligible. You just need to file a travel claim after each appointment (either through the VA Travel Pay Portal or at the VA facility). *Where:* For local vets, the St. Louis VA (Jefferson Barracks or John Cochran division) travel office processes these. Many clinics have kiosks or you can use the online BTSSS portal.

* **Vocational Rehabilitation (VR\&E) Automatic Eligibility:** At 30%, you are generally considered to have an “employment handicap” by VA for VR\&E purposes. It becomes easier to get accepted into **Chapter 31 Voc Rehab** if you haven’t already. If you haven’t used this and need retraining or education, definitely apply now (see 10% section for details). The higher your rating, the more likely you are to be approved for comprehensive training services.

* **Illinois Veterans’ Homes Preference:** Veterans with service-connected disabilities are given preference for admission to state veterans’ nursing homes. At 30%, you are quite likely to get priority if you ever need to apply to a Veterans Home. (As noted, this is generally for older or severely disabled vets who need that care.)

* **Dependent and Survivor Benefits Awareness:** Once you’re 30%+, start being aware of programs for dependents in case your condition worsens. For instance, **Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC)** is a benefit for surviving spouses if a veteran’s death is service-connected (or if the vet was 100% P\&T for 10+ years). While not directly applicable at 30%, it’s something to keep in mind and inform your spouse about at higher ratings. Similarly, family members might qualify for certain educational aid if your disability is substantial (see 100% section for details). At 30% itself, there isn’t a direct new dependent benefit, but you’ve crossed the threshold to get the extra compensation for them as noted.

* **State Employment Preference:** Illinois offers **veterans hiring preference** for state jobs (similar to federal). All honorably discharged vets get a preference, but disabled veterans (usually defined as 10% or more) often get a higher preference. For example, on state employment exams, additional points or preference is given if you have a VA disability (the specifics can vary by agency or if under civil service commission rules). Always mention your vet status and disability on state job applications. Some counties and cities also give disabled vets preference points on their employment exams (for police, fire, etc.).

* **License and Fee Waivers:** Some professional licensing fees and testing fees can be waived for veterans. By state law, certain fees are waived for military families (active duty and spouses). For disabled vets specifically, if you’re pursuing a trade that requires state licensure (e.g. plumbing, electrical), check with the Illinois Dept of Financial and Professional Regulation to see if your fees can be waived under any veteran program or if your military training can satisfy some requirements (many boards accept military experience in place of schooling).

* **Recreation and Other Discounts:** At 30%, you qualify for the **Illinois Persons with Disability ID card (Class 2 or 2A)** which we discussed for camping. With that card, besides camping, you may get discounts at some park district facilities, city recreation programs, or private attractions. Always ask. For example, the City of O’Fallon or Belleville might allow disabled veterans to get resident rates or free entry for certain municipal recreation (this can vary; inquire locally). Also, Illinois offers a **Free Fishing and Hunting License for** *any* veteran **returning from deployment** (the Illinois **Armed Forces Recreation License**), which provides a free combo license for up to 2 years after return – at 30%, you likely already use the 10% card which covers you indefinitely, but if not, know that such programs exist.

* **Military License Plates (one-time fee waiver):** Note that the **free military license plate** benefit in Illinois (detailed under 50%) requires 50%+. At 30%, you still have to pay annual fees if you get a specialty plate. However, you can certainly get any of the Illinois military service plates (like one that notes your branch or medal) – you just pay the normal registration fee. If you have a meritorious medal (Purple Heart, Medal of Honor, etc.), separate plate types exist that often carry their own benefits (Purple Heart plates are issued without registration fees regardless of disability, by Illinois law). So if you are a Purple Heart recipient with 30% rating, you actually already qualify for a free Purple Heart plate.

* **Local County Veteran Assistance:** At 30%, if you find yourself struggling (e.g. unable to work fully but only receiving partial VA comp), remember the county Veterans Assistance Commissions mentioned earlier. Many 30%–40% disabled vets use VACs for help with VA claims (for increasing ratings or filing new claims) or emergency assistance. VACs also sometimes have partnerships with local transit (some provide free van rides to VA hospitals), and can direct you to non-profit help (like the Salvation Army or St. Vincent de Paul, which in some counties have special aid for veterans).

* **Support Groups and Rehab:** In the Scott AFB/St. Louis region, as your rating climbs you might be dealing with more significant health issues. The VA medical centers host support groups for conditions like PTSD, amputee rehab, etc. The Belleville VA Outpatient Clinic (which is near Scott AFB) offers mental health services and group therapy for veterans – something to consider taking advantage of as part of your benefits.

**Documentation Required at 30%:** The VA **award letter** or benefits summary showing your 30% rating is crucial. To apply for property tax exemption, you’ll need that letter each year. For adding dependents, VA may ask for marriage certificates or birth certificates. When seeking hiring preferences or other benefits, always carry a copy of your VA disability percentage letter. If you use eBenefits or VA.gov, you can download a “Benefits Verification” letter that states your current percentage and whether you’re being paid.

**How to Apply / Where:**

* **Property Tax Exemption:** Contact your **County Assessor’s Office**. e.g., Madison County residents would go to the Madison County Chief County Assessment Office website or office; St. Clair residents to theirs. Each will have a form called something like “Application for Disabled Veterans Standard Homestead Exemption (PTAX-342)\*\*. Submit by the deadline (usually before fall).
* **VA Travel Pay:** Use the **VA Travel Reimbursement portal (BTSSS)** or apply in person at the VA after appointments. Staff can assist if you’re unsure.
* **Dependent Compensation:** Through VA either online (VA.gov -> Add a dependent) or via paper form to the VA Regional Office.
* **Federal Jobs:** Use USAJOBS and indicate preference; for 30% appointment, contact agency HR directly.
* **VAC Services:** Visit or call your county VAC (addresses as in 0% section). They will help with paperwork for many of these benefits if you need assistance.

In essence, at 30% you start getting substantial state benefits (especially property tax relief) and additional VA perks. This level is often when a part-time or fully disabled veteran might combine VA comp with part-time work or vocational rehab to maintain a livelihood. Make sure you utilize the tax break and any educational/vocational assistance to stretch your compensation further.

## 50% Disability Rating

A **50% VA disability rating** is a major milestone unlocking **full medical coverage** from the VA and many of the most valuable state benefits. At 50%, you are now considered “half” disabled by VA standards, and Illinois as well as federal programs provide additional support. You receive everything at the lower ratings (0-30%) plus:

* **VA Health Care – Priority Group 1:** At **50% or higher**, you are placed in **Priority Group 1 for VA health care**, which means **you pay **no** co-pays for any medical care or prescriptions through the VA**. In other words, *all* of your VA health care is free – whether it’s for your service-connected conditions or completely unrelated conditions. This is a huge benefit if you have frequent medical appointments or medications. You also get free VA dental care eligibility if you are rated 100% (or unemployable) – but at 50% alone, comprehensive dental is not automatic (100% is needed for that; see 100% section). *Note:* If you previously had private insurance or Medicare, you can still use VA as well; many 50%+ vets use VA for most care to avoid co-pays. *Documentation:* VA should automatically assign Priority 1 once your rating hits 50%. Just ensure your VA healthcare enrollment reflects the update.

* **Property Tax Exemption – Increased:** At 50%, your Illinois homestead exemption on property taxes jumps to **\$5,000 off EAV**. This will further reduce your property tax beyond what you got at 30%. (For example, if you were at 40% last year and now 50%, your exemption doubles from \$2,500 to \$5,000 of EAV.) In practical terms, that could save roughly \$200–\$400 more on your tax bill, depending on local tax rates. *Action:* Re-file with the County Assessor to show your updated rating. They will apply the larger exemption for the next tax year.

* **Free Illinois License Plates (One Vehicle):** Illinois law grants **one set of free military or veteran license plates** (no annual registration fee) to veterans with **50% or greater** service-connected disability. This is a significant savings (the IL registration fee is about \$151/year). You are not limited to the generic “Disabled Veteran” plate – you can choose any of the military series specialty plates (e.g., branch of service, campaign medal plates like Afghanistan or Iraq Veteran, Purple Heart, etc.) and you will get that plate’s registration fee waived for one vehicle. *Who qualifies:* Illinois resident veterans rated 50% or higher by VA. *Documentation:* A VA award letter or certification showing 50%+. *Where to apply:* Through the **Illinois Secretary of State**. You will fill out the Military License Plate form for the specific plate you want (for example, Form VSD 375 for a campaign medal plate or VSD 702 for Disabled Veteran plate). On the form, indicate you are 50%+ service-connected and attach a copy of your VA letter. The local DMV might not be familiar with the fee waiver (as the change took effect in 2020), so you may need to politely point them to ILCS 5/3-609.3 (the law) or have them contact the Special Plates Division in Springfield. Many veterans have had success by going through their County Veterans Assistance Commission or IDVA office to process the plate paperwork to Springfield. *Note:* This covers the annual registration fee for one vehicle; you would still pay for additional sets or vanity plate upcharges. Also, if you have a \*\*50%+ rating and a qualifying **mobility disability**, you could get a Disabled Veteran plate *with* the wheelchair symbol (for handicapped parking) – that requires a separate medical certification (same as any disabled parking placard) in addition to your VA letter.

* **Illinois Hunting/Fishing & Camping:** (Recap) At 50%, you already have the same hunting/fishing license exemption as at 10%. For camping, note that separate from the Class 2 disability discounts, Illinois law **fully exempts 100% disabled veterans and former POWs** from camping fees. At 50%, you don’t automatically get free camping *by statute*, but practically, as mentioned, with the Class 2A card you do get either free or discounted camping. However, **if your 50% rating involves loss of use of an arm/leg or you are wheelchair-bound**, you actually meet the criteria of the law that grants free camping. The law states an Illinois veteran with a **permanent disability 100% OR loss of use of limb OR inability to move without wheelchair/crutches** gets all camping and admission fees waived. For example, if part of your 50% includes an amputation or paralysis, you could get the DNR’s free camping permit (often called the “Special Armed Forces” camping permit). Check with IDNR if you think this applies. Otherwise, continue using the standard disabled camping discount.

* **CHAMPVA for Spouse/Dependents:** *This requires 100% P\&T*, so not at 50%. (We will discuss under 100%.)

* **VA Caregiver Program:** If you have serious disabilities and need a caregiver’s assistance, the **Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers (PCAFC)** might apply. Currently, post-9/11 veterans of any rating can apply, and by Oct 2022 veterans of all eras became eligible. While rating isn’t the sole factor (it’s based on needing assistance with activities of daily living or supervision due to serious injury/illness), many participants are 50%+. If you, for example, cannot dress, bathe, or manage medication on your own and a family member cares for you, that family member could get a stipend and training through PCAFC. *Who qualifies:* Those with a serious service-connected injury or illness requiring caregiver support. *Where to apply:* Through the VA Caregiver website or St. Louis VA Caregiver Support office. (Mentioned here as many 50%+ vets explore it as conditions worsen.)

* **Space-Available Flights (Military Air):** 100% disabled vets get this (see 100%), not at 50%. However, as a veteran you can still access certain military recreation facilities. Now that you have base access (from 0% benefit), you could potentially use on-base lodging (AF Inns) and recreation on a Space-A basis. For example, Scott AFB has recreational equipment rental, and as a vet with base access you can use those services; they also have FamCamp for RV camping which you can use.

* **State and Local Taxes:** Illinois income tax already exempts VA disability pay. If you work, you continue to be eligible for the **Illinois Disabled Veterans Standard Income Tax Exemption** – this is actually covered by the property tax homestead, not on income tax. There is no additional state income tax break at 50%. However, check local county taxes/fees: some counties waive fees for disabled vets on things like vehicle sticker or city sticker. For instance, the City of Belleville has in the past waived vehicle sticker fees for disabled veterans with DV plates. It’s worth inquiring at your city/village hall.

* **Employment & Education:** At 50%, some veterans consider if they can still work full-time. If you’re able and seeking employment, remember the federal “Schedule A” hiring authority for people with disabilities (including disabled vets) – you likely qualify for that with a 50% rating. Also, **Project HERO** and other VA vocational rehabilitation special programs might assist if you have difficulty working. If working is not feasible, you might start to consider **Individual Unemployability** (TDIU) if your disabilities prevent substantially gainful employment (covered under 80/90/100% below).

* **Dependent Benefits (Chapter 35 DEA):** Not yet at 50%. (Starts at 100% P\&T.)

* **Local Veterans Organizations:** With a higher disability, it may be beneficial to get involved with veteran service organizations (American Legion, VFW, DAV, etc.). Many offer assistance programs. For example, DAV (Disabled American Veterans) can help with claims and also operates **DAV vans** providing free transportation to VA hospitals for disabled vets who can’t drive (there is a DAV van network – one picks up at the O’Fallon, IL VA clinic to go to St. Louis VA). As a 50% vet, DAV membership is free for life if you are 100% but at 50% you still pay dues, however there are often local resources reserved for “disabled vets” through these orgs. In the Scott AFB area, there’s a DAV Chapter in Belleville and a Disabled Veterans Honor Flight program (to DC) that you might qualify for sooner as a higher-rated vet.

* **Emergency Assistance & Relief:** At 50% you’re getting a decent VA check (\~\$1,000+/mo for a single vet). If that’s not enough due to unemployment or high expenses, the **Illinois Veterans’ Assistance Fund** (administered by IDVA) might provide some grants. Also, **Ameren Illinois Utility Grants:** As seen in June 2022, Ameren ran a program offering \$100 energy grants for disabled vets. Keep an eye for such programs from utilities or nonprofits especially in Metro East St. Louis; they often target vets with disabilities for assistance in paying heating bills (Contact Ameren or Southwest Illinois Electric Coop if applicable and ask about veteran programs).

* **Documentation at 50%:** Keep that VA letter showing “50 percent service-connected” safe. You will use it for plates, property tax, perhaps utility programs, etc. Also, the Illinois Secretary of State might give you a *permanent disability identification card* if you have certain disabilities – separate from veteran status – but typically your VA letter suffices for veteran-specific ones.

* **Where to Apply Summary for New Benefits:**

  * *License Plate:* DMV or through IDVA/VAC (with VA letter).
  * *Property Tax:* County Assessor (with VA letter).
  * *VA Health:* No action needed beyond using VA care; system knows your co-pays drop to \$0.
  * *Travel Pay:* Already covered – just continue using it.
  * *Caregiver Program:* VA Caregiver Support Program application (if needed).
  * *VAC Emergency Aid:* VAC office (if experiencing financial hardship).
  * *Ameren Grant:* Check Ameren’s **Military Support Program** (they host events or have an application for veterans for bill assistance).
  * *DAV Transportation:* Contact Jefferson Barracks VA Voluntary Services or local DAV Chapter to schedule rides.

At 50%, you have a strong safety net: free health care, basically no property taxes on a moderate home (if you combine the \$5K exemption with other general homestead exemptions you might have), no car registration fee on one vehicle, and steady income from VA. The next big jump is at 70/100% for total tax exemption and family benefits, but 50% is already a point where many vets feel significant relief. Make sure to maximize these benefits – for example, if you haven’t been using VA health care much, now is the time to move your prescriptions to the VA (save money) and get any specialty care you need without worrying about co-pays.

## 80% Disability Rating

At **80% VA disability**, you are a highly-rated disabled veteran. Interestingly, many benefits do **not** differentiate between 70%, 80%, or 90% – the key thresholds were at 50% and then at 100%. However, at 70% and above, Illinois gives you the maximum property tax relief (100% exemption), and the VA has provisions like Individual Unemployability that become easier to obtain. We will outline what an 80% (and 90%) veteran should know:

* **Property Tax – 70% and Above = No Tax:** Once you hit **70% or higher in Illinois, you pay no property tax on your primary residence** (provided its EAV is under \$250,000). So as an 80% rated veteran, you qualify for a **100% property tax exemption** on your home. This is through the same Disabled Veterans Homestead Exemption, now at the full level. *Action:* If you just crossed from 50-69% into 70+ (say your rating increased to 80% this year), you need to re-file with the Assessor to get the full exemption. Once approved, each year you still must submit the renewal form to certify you remain the owner/occupant. This exemption can literally save you thousands of dollars each year depending on your property’s value. (It effectively wipes out the taxable value up to \$250K EAV, which covers a large majority of homes in the region.)

* **VA Compensation:** At 80%, the VA payment is substantial (roughly \$1,900+ per month for single veteran in 2025). If you have a spouse or kids, it’s higher. Ensure VA knows about all dependents as you’ve been entitled to those add-ons since 30%.

* **Individual Unemployability (IU/TDIU):** If you are **80%** and **unable to maintain substantially gainful employment** due to your service-connected conditions, consider applying for Total Disability based on Individual Unemployability. IU allows the VA to pay you at the **100% rate even if you are not 100% schedular**, because your conditions prevent working. The general VA criteria: if you have one disability at 60% or a combined rating of 70% or more (with one disability at least 40%), you meet the schedular requirements for IU. At 80%, you definitely meet the percentage threshold. You’ll need to show that your service-connected disabilities, in combination, keep you from holding a job. Many 80% and 90% vets get IU, especially if their disabilities include things like severe PTSD, serious orthopedic issues, etc. *Benefit:* You get paid at the 100% rate and are considered by VA as “total” – which also opens up things like CHAMPVA for dependents, Chapter 35 education, etc., *if IU is granted as permanent*. *How to apply:* File VA Form 21-8940 (Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability). Provide details about your work history and how your disabilities affect work. A VSO can assist. If granted, you’ll receive a letter indicating you are being paid at 100% due to unemployability (often with an indication if it’s considered permanent).

* **Permanent & Total (P\&T) Status:** At 80%, VA may or may not deem you “Permanent and Total.” P\&T is not guaranteed at any specific rating, but many vets with 80/90% (especially older vets or those with static conditions) do get P\&T. P\&T means no further routine exams are scheduled and you and your dependents become eligible for certain additional benefits (notably CHAMPVA and DEA education for family). Check your VA award letter – if it says something like “basic eligibility to Dependents’ Educational Assistance established” or mentions Chapter 35, that means you are P\&T. If you’re 80% but not P\&T, the dependents’ benefits below (CHAMPVA, DEA) won’t kick in until you reach 100% or IU P\&T.

* **100% State Benefits Already Effectively Applied:** Illinois doesn’t have anything beyond the property tax that changes after 70%. So at 80%, you are already getting the max property tax break, and you’ve been eligible for the free plates, etc. There are no additional state benefit jumps at 80% versus 70%. The next mentionable jump in Illinois might be at **100% specifically for things like a special state employment status** (some state hiring or civil service pension laws treat 100% differently) and maybe some unique local perks.

* **Free Automobile Registration for Additional Vehicles:** Illinois law explicitly gives one free plate set at 50%+. If you have more than one vehicle, unfortunately you do have to pay for the others (unless you are 100% P\&T, in which case you could get your spouse a free plate as a surviving spouse benefit if you were deceased – not applicable now). So 80% doesn’t increase number of free plates. However, if you *and* your spouse are both veterans with disabilities, each could get one free plate, but that’s uncommon.

* **Healthcare & Medical Equipment:** At 80%, use the VA for all healthcare needs (as at 50%). Also, if you need medical equipment or adaptive devices for daily living due to your disabilities, VA provides those free. For example, if you need a wheelchair, scooter, hearing aids (usually provided if you have any compensable rating), prosthetic devices, or home improvements for disability (ramps, grab bars) – contact the VA Prosthetics department. They have programs like HISA (Home Improvement and Structural Alteration grant) that can provide a few thousand dollars to modify your home for easier access if needed.

* **Adaptive Auto Equipment:** If your disabilities include certain conditions (like limited mobility of legs, or loss of extremity function), you might be eligible for the VA’s **Automobile Adaptive Equipment** benefit. For example, if at 80% you have residuals that affect driving (like loss of use of a foot or severe neuropathy), VA can pay to install hand controls, left-foot accelerators, etc., in your vehicle. You do not need to be 100% for this; it’s based on the specific disability (typically requires service-connected loss or loss of use of foot or hand, etc.). Also, **Automobile Grant**: A one-time grant (\~\$24,000) to buy a vehicle if you have very specific injuries (loss of both feet, permanent loss of use of both hands, severe vision loss, ALS, etc.). If that pertains to you at 80%, you likely know about it. *Where to apply:* Through VA Form 21-4502 for the auto grant; through the VA prosthetics department for adaptive equipment.

* **Illinois State Park Pass for Vehicle:** This isn’t widely needed (IL parks mostly free), but note that disabled veterans are eligible for a **free state park camping pass** as discussed. At 80%, if you haven’t gotten that and plan on camping often, ask IDNR about any “Veterans Special Access Pass.” (The earlier law excerpt indicates 100% or certain permanent disabilities get free camping and admission, which would cover entry fees to places like Illinois State Fair as well possibly, but in general Illinois doesn’t charge park entry.)

* **Family Benefits – CHAMPVA & DEA:** If you are **80% P\&T** or if you obtain IU (Individual Unemployability) that is deemed **permanent**, your spouse and children become eligible for:

  * **CHAMPVA Health Insurance:** This is federal health coverage for dependents of veterans who are P\&T disabled. It functions similar to TRICARE. If you’re 80% but not P\&T, hold on until you either get P\&T or 100%.
  * **Chapter 35 Dependents’ Education Assistance (DEA):** This provides monthly stipends for your spouse or children to pursue education (a few hundred dollars a month for schooling for up to 45 months of schooling). Again, requires P\&T or death in line of duty.
  * If you reach a point where VA says you’re totally disabled permanently (could happen at 80 or 90), these kick in. Otherwise, these will come at 100% (next section).

* **Social Security Disability (SSDI):** Many 80%+ veterans may also qualify for SSDI if they cannot work. Being 80% by itself doesn’t guarantee SSDI, but if your conditions are severe, consider applying to Social Security. SSA has a flag for 100% P\&T vets to fast-track, but even at 80% you can be approved, especially if IU. This is outside VA/Illinois, but worth noting.

* **Local County Advantages:** Check if your county offers any special programs for higher-rated vets. For instance, some counties’ VACs give higher assistance limits to more disabled vets. Or a county might have a program like “hero discounts” partnering with local businesses giving bigger discounts to 100% disabled – sometimes 50%+ or 70%+ vets qualify. Monroe County, for example, had a project for building disability ramps for veterans in need (through local veteran organizations). At 80%, you may find more community support or willingness to assist from nonprofits if you request.

* **Survivor Financial Benefits:** If, God forbid, you were to pass away from your service-connected conditions, your spouse would be eligible for Dependency & Indemnity Compensation (DIC). Even if your death is not service-related, if you were 100% P\&T for 10+ years, your spouse would get DIC. At 80%, keep in mind if you maintain that rating or higher for 10 years, that rule could apply if you later get 100%. Just something for long-term planning.

* **Planning for 100%:** Many 80% vets aim for that final 100% schedular rating. If you have additional conditions not yet rated or conditions that have worsened, consider filing for an increase or secondary conditions. For example, an 80% combined rating could be something like PTSD 50% + knee 30% + tinnitus 10% + etc. If your PTSD worsens to 70% or 100%, or you develop new secondary issues (like hypertension secondary to PTSD), you could push into 100%. Use your local Veteran Service Officer (like those at the VAC or IDVA) to review your file and see if you should pursue an increase.

**Summary for 80%/90%:** *The benefits at 80% and 90% are largely the same as at 70%.* You have maximal state tax relief, free medical care, free plates, etc. The main focus at this stage is ensuring you and your family are covered (consider IU if not working, check P\&T status, and plan for transition to 100% benefits). Continue to use all previously earned benefits. Now we’ll cover 90% (which is similar) and then 100% where the remaining big benefits (family health, etc.) fully kick in.

## 90% Disability Rating

A **90% VA disability rating** is very similar to 80% in terms of benefits. There are no new Illinois-specific benefits that start exactly at 90%. The main difference is you’re likely only one step away from 100%, and your monthly VA compensation is higher (\~\$2,140/month for single veteran in 2025). All benefits for 70%+ (including full property tax exemption, Priority Group 1 health care, free plates, etc.) apply at 90%. We’ll highlight a few considerations:

* **Property Tax:** You remain fully exempt as per 70%+ rule (no taxes on primary home).

* **VA Health & Pharmacy:** Still all free. At 90%, if you take any expensive medications, you save a lot by getting them through VA with \$0 copay.

* **P\&T Status:** By 90%, VA often will concede P\&T status especially if your disabilities have been static or you’re older. If your award letter still doesn’t mention dependents’ Chapter 35 eligibility, you might request your VSO to ask VA for a P\&T determination (especially if your conditions are not expected to improve). If P\&T is granted at 90%, your family can start using CHAMPVA and DEA, just as if you were 100%. (Often, however, VA might just rate you 100% if you’re that close and unemployable.)

* **Individual Unemployability:** If you haven’t yet applied and you can’t work, definitely consider it at 90%. You meet the schedular criteria easily. Getting IU would pay you at 100% rate and confer the same benefits as 100% P\&T (provided your IU is granted as permanent). Many veterans in the 80–90% range get IU approved relatively quickly if evidence shows inability to work. *Note:* if you are working (even part-time) at above marginal levels, IU might not be granted. Some 90% vets choose to keep working and pursue the last 10% through schedular means.

* **100% Goal – Exams:** When you push from 90% to 100%, sometimes it requires a new C\&P exam or appeal. Just be aware that at 90%, VA might schedule periodic exams for certain conditions (e.g. if a condition was expected to improve). Once you hit a stable 100% or P\&T, exams usually stop. So one more reason to aim for either 100% or secure IU/P\&T and then no more routine future exams.

* **Other State Benefits:** Illinois offers some additional benefits that apply broadly to disabled veterans (not tied to specific rating), which you likely already know but worth mentioning:

  * **Free Veterans’ Cemeteries:** Illinois has state veterans cemeteries (e.g., one at Albia, though many in the area use Jefferson Barracks National). Burial at a state veteran cemetery is free for the veteran and usually for spouse. Rating doesn’t matter, just veteran status.
  * **Military Fee Exemption for Petitions in Court:** Illinois waives certain court fees for disabled veterans in specific cases (for example, if you need to petition for guardianship of a disabled veteran, etc., under the Veterans Guardianship Act).
  * **License Fee Discounts (Benefit Access Program):** If you are 90% and have low income, you might have applied to Benefit Access. That program also gives one reduced-fee vehicle registration (\$24 instead of \$151) for seniors/disabled. However, since you get a free plate already via the veteran route, BAP’s car benefit is moot. But BAP also gives you free transit rides as discussed.

* **Local Honors:** Some counties or cities issue an honorific ID or coin for highly disabled vets. For example, some Illinois counties have a “Veteran ID card” from the county clerk/recorder (mainly to prove veteran status for discounts). While not a benefit per se, it might be something to pick up if available (often these are free and can be useful if you don’t have a REAL ID with Veteran designation).

* **Home Improvement Exemption (Specially Adapted Housing):** If you at 90% have used a VA Specially Adapted Housing (SAH) grant to modify or build a wheelchair-accessible home (say due to serious injuries), Illinois offers a **\$100,000 EAV reduction** separate from the standard homestead. This is for those who *received a federal SAH grant*. If you fall into this category, it stacks with or is separate from the other exemption (essentially ensuring even more expensive adapted homes have a tax break). Check with your assessor – usually, you can’t use both the \$100k SAH exemption and the standard one simultaneously, you’d use whichever is more beneficial. But since you have 90% (≥70%), you already have full exemption, making it moot. The \$100k exemption would come into play if your home’s EAV exceeded \$250k cap or if for some reason you weren’t eligible for the standard homestead. Just be aware it exists for *permanent total* disabled who got housing assistance.

* **FACILITIES and NGOs:** At the 90% level, you may also qualify for certain nonprofit programs. For example, the Gary Sinise Foundation R.I.S.E program builds specially adapted smart homes for severely wounded vets (usually 100% disabled though, like quadruple amputees, etc.). Or organizations like Operation Homefront might help with financial assistance if needed. Keep an eye on charity programs specifically for “catastrophically” disabled vets, as some consider 70%+ or 90%+ as criteria.

* **Connection with Scott AFB:** Scott AFB has a robust **Airman & Family Readiness Center** which also serves retirees and veterans in some capacity. While their primary role is for active duty, they do host Transition Assistance and occasional veteran job fairs – as a 90% disabled vet, you might benefit from any DoD sponsored transition workshops if you haven’t attended one. Also, base legal office might assist with wills/POA for retirees; some extend that courtesy to disabled vets as well.

* **Family Readiness:** If you have a spouse or dependents, at 90% it’s crucial to ensure they are aware of potential benefits coming at 100%. For instance, prepare them that once you reach 100% or if you pass and it’s service-connected, they should apply for CHAMPVA or DIC. Sometimes dependents aren’t well-informed, so now is a good time to connect them with an IDVA representative who can brief them on what to do in the future.

In essence, **90% has all the same perks as 80%**. It’s a waiting room for 100%, so to speak. The financial differences (a bit more comp) and the psychological benefit of being “almost there” are notable. Treat yourself to any local recognition events – some communities honor vets with 90%+ or 100% at parades or events. You have sacrificed much, and you should leverage every bit of support out there.

## 100% Disability Rating

A **100% VA disability rating** (or equivalent through IU with P\&T) is the top tier, and it opens the full spectrum of benefits for you **and your family**. This includes significant federal benefits, state privileges, and local honors. We will cover financial, healthcare, education, and service benefits at 100%, noting which require the **100% Permanent and Total (P\&T)** status specifically.

* **VA Compensation:** At 100%, your base VA compensation is about \$3,621 per month (2025 rate for single veteran), **tax-free**, and additional for each dependent (e.g., +\$170 spouse, +\$120 per child, etc.). If you reached 100% via **Individual Unemployability (IU)** and it’s considered permanent, the VA treats you largely the same as 100% schedular. Verify if your decision letter says you are **Permanent & Total**. If so, all dependents benefits apply. If not P\&T, VA may schedule future exams.

* **Priority Group 1 Healthcare + Dental:** You continue to have all VA care with no copays (same as 50%+). The **new healthcare benefit at 100% is VA Dental Care** – veterans who are 100% service-connected (or IU 100% P\&T) are eligible for comprehensive dental treatment at the VA. This means you can go to the VA dentist for routine cleanings, fillings, dentures, etc., free of charge. (If you’re 100% but not P\&T and they still consider the possibility of improvement, they still give dental as long as you’re 100% schedular.) *Action:* Contact the St. Louis VA Medical Center dental clinic (or if there’s a closer one, possibly John Cochran VA in St. Louis has dental, or Marion VA). They will verify eligibility and schedule you.

* **CHAMPVA – Health Insurance for Dependents:** One of the biggest benefits at 100% P\&T is **CHAMPVA**. This is a health insurance program for your spouse and children (who are not eligible for TRICARE). It covers around 75% of medical costs and works with most providers (many treat it similar to secondary insurance to Medicare or primary if under 65). *Who qualifies:* The spouse or widow(er) and children of a veteran rated **100% Permanent and Total** service-connected. Also qualifies if you are IU P\&T. *Documentation:* VA will send you a “Certificate of Eligibility” for CHAMPVA after granting P\&T. If not, you can apply with VA Form 10-10d and include a copy of the VA award letter. *Where to apply:* CHAMPVA Office in Denver or online via VA’s website. *Coverage:* It covers most medical and mental health services, prescription drugs (via Meds by Mail or network pharmacies), and has an annual catastrophic cap. **Important:** CHAMPVA requires the dependents to not be eligible for DoD’s TRICARE. If you as the veteran are retired military (and thus your family have TRICARE), they won’t use CHAMPVA. But in most cases for disabled vets, CHAMPVA is the option. Also, once dependents turn 18, they must be full-time students to stay eligible until 23. Spouses lose CHAMPVA if they divorce or if the veteran is no longer P\&T (rare scenario).

* **Chapter 35 Dependents’ Education (DEA):** With 100% P\&T, your spouse and children are eligible for **education benefits**. Each can receive **Chapter 35 DEA**, which currently is about a \$1,401 monthly stipend (for full-time schooling) paid directly to the student. They can use it for college, technical or vocational courses, even some apprenticeships. It’s available for up to 36-45 months of schooling. Children can use it between ages 18 and 26 (generally), spouses have 10 years from the date you got P\&T (20 years if you were 100% within 3 years of discharge). *How to use:* They must apply via VA Form 22-5490. *Documentation:* Your VA award showing basic eligibility for Chapter 35 (which should be on your letter). The Illinois Department of Veterans’ Affairs or ISAC can also help coordinate this alongside state benefits.

* **State Education Benefits for Family:** In addition to federal DEA, Illinois has the **MIA/POW Scholarship** (also called the **Illinois Veterans’ Dependents Tuition Waiver**). Despite its name, it covers dependents of veterans who are 100% service-connected disabled (as well as those killed in action, etc.). It **waives all tuition and certain fees at Illinois state universities or community colleges** for your spouse and children. Essentially, your kids/spouse can attend any Illinois state-supported college **tuition-free** (undergrad or graduate) if you are 100% P\&T. *This can be used in combination with or instead of Chapter 35.* The state scholarship typically covers tuition and *some* fees, while DEA can help with living expenses. Illinois also has a separate program by county (Children of Veterans Scholarship at U of I) but the MIA/POW Scholarship is the big one for 100% vets’ families. *Documentation:* Application through IDVA – you need to provide your 100% award letter and proof of Illinois residency at time of entry into service (the veteran must have entered service from IL). *Where to apply:* The application is on the **ISAC website** and is often coordinated by IDVA’s field offices or the financial aid office of the school. Each child can get up to the equivalent of 4 years of schooling. There is **no limit on number of children** – each qualified child can get it.

* **State Licensing and Fees:** At 100%, there are a few extra state perks:

  * The **Illinois Department of Natural Resources** offers a **“Golden Access” type card** for veterans who are 100% which gives free admission to all state parks, museums, etc. (Many of these were already free or covered by camping exemption, but if an admission fee exists, it’s waived).
  * Some **professional licensing fees** are completely waived for 100% disabled veterans. For example, the Illinois Commerce Commission may waive trucking owner-operator license fees if the owner is a 100% disabled vet (check specific boards for policies).
  * **Passport Fee Waiver:** Not Illinois-specific, but federal: 100% disabled veterans are eligible for a one-time free passport (application fee is waived). You must apply by mail using form DS-11 and include proof of the disability (VA letter) and a letter requesting the fee waiver under the Disabled Veteran’s Passport program.

* **Transportation & Parking:**

  * **Illinois Tollway:** Illinois does not have a blanket toll exemption for disabled vets as some states do, but if you have a vehicle with disabled plates and need to use *I-PASS*, there might be a program to get a discounted toll rate. Currently, no official statewide toll waiver for DV plates is active in IL (unlike some other states).
  * **Handicapped Parking:** If you are 100% (especially if you have any mobility issues), get the **Disabled Veteran (DV) license plate with the wheelchair symbol** or at least a permanent disabled parking placard. This will allow you to use handicap parking spaces. In many Illinois municipalities (like Chicago), those with certain disability placards (specifically the yellow-and-green striped meter-exempt placard) can park at meters for free with no time limit. Disabled veterans *who have a doctor certify they cannot manage parking meters* can apply for that placard. This is very useful in cities. *How to get:* Have your doctor fill out the Persons with Disabilities Certification (Form VSD 62) indicating you have Type I disability (which qualifies for meter-exempt placard), and submit to Secretary of State.

* **Military BasePrivileges Enhanced:** While all service-connected vets had commissary/exchange access since 2020, 100% disabled veterans have long been recognized on base similarly to military retirees. Many bases (including Scott AFB) issue a base ID for 100% disabled vets (a DD Form 2765, tan color ID card) that can ease base entry (though nowadays VHIC works too). At 100%, you and your family members may also be eligible for base recreational privileges that others might not get. For example, some bases allow 100% DAV veterans to use the base hobby shops, outdoor recreation rentals, etc., where lower rated vets might be limited to just commissary/MWR ticket office. It’s base-specific in some cases. But generally, being 100% P\&T, you can:

  * Use Space-A travel on military flights (Category VI, same as retirees) for both you and an attending caregiver (if needed).
  * Get discounted rates at Armed Forces Recreation Center resorts (like Shades of Green, though all honorably discharged vets can now at certain times).
  * Possibly get your spouse a military ID card (the 100% DAV Dependent ID) which allows them base access without you (helpful for them to shop or use facilities on their own).

* **Survivor Benefits (DIC & others):** If you are 100% P\&T, your spouse is eligible for **DIC** if you die from any cause **after** you’ve held the 100% rating for 10 years. If (touch wood) you pass from a service-connected issue, they get DIC regardless of time. DIC (2025) is about \$1,562/month for a surviving spouse, plus add-ons for kids. Also, your spouse could continue to use CHAMPVA for life, and certain state benefits continue for them (e.g., surviving spouse can continue to get the property tax exemption on the residence and keep one vehicle with free registration as long as they don’t remarry and remain at that residence). *Note:* Illinois law extends the homestead exemption to the **unremarried surviving spouse** of a veteran who was receiving it. So your spouse would continue to pay no property tax on the home even after you’re gone, which is a huge relief in their old age. They would need to apply as surviving spouse with DIC letter, etc.

* **Veterans’ Homes and Nursing Care:** At 100%, if you ever need to go into a nursing home, you might be eligible for VA’s Aid & Attendance benefit on top of your compensation (but usually compensation being high disqualifies from pension-based A\&A – instead, VA might cover some contracted nursing home costs if your care is for SC conditions). Illinois veterans homes, when a vet is 70% or more SC, the VA will actually pay most of the cost for care in a state veteran home. That means the state home may accept you with little to no out-of-pocket from you, as the VA subsidizes a 70%+ disabled veteran’s nursing home care. So if considering long-term care, look into the Illinois Veterans Homes first, as there may be minimal costs due to your rating.

* **Miscellaneous Benefits at 100%:**

  * **Commissary Surcharge Waiver:** Normally a 5% surcharge is added at commissaries; some talk that 100% P\&T vets might get surcharges waived – but currently *all* patrons pay the surcharge, no exemption (the surcharge is mandated by Congress for facility upkeep).
  * **Federal Taxes:** While VA compensation is tax-free, note that if you have a military retirement, you can consider CRDP/CRSC programs (those are DoD, for concurrent receipt). At 100%, you definitely get full Concurrent Retirement and Disability Pay if you are a military retiree (meaning you can get full retired pay and VA comp simultaneously).
  * **Recreational Free Passes:** The National Park Service offers a **Free Lifetime Access Pass** for veterans with permanent disabilities. You likely qualify – you can apply with your VA proof at any national park. This gives you free entry to national parks and federal recreation lands nationwide (and sometimes discounts on amenities). All veterans (even without disabilities) now qualify for a free annual pass, but the Access Pass is lifetime for disabled.
  * **Illinois State Fair & Other Events:** Often, 100% disabled vets get special recognition or free admission. For example, the IL State Fair (Springfield and DuQuoin) typically has a “Veterans Day” where all vets enter free. Some local fairs or events might allow 100% DAV in free anytime. This is ad hoc; keep an ear out through your VAC or local news.

* **Documentation & Application at 100%:**

  * The VA will send an updated benefit summary. Use that to apply for CHAMPVA (for each dependent), Chapter 35 (each dependent files their own VA form for DEA).
  * Illinois MIA/POW Scholarship: fill out the application from ISAC/IDVA, include proof of IL residency at veteran’s entry to service, your 100% award letter, and your child’s birth certificate or spouse’s marriage certificate. Submit to IDVA or ISAC as directed.
  * Property Tax Surviving Spouse: ensure your spouse knows to re-file as surviving spouse if needed (with your death certificate and proof of DIC).
  * Free License Plates for Surviving Spouse: Illinois allows the surviving spouse of a 100% disabled vet to continue receiving one set of plates without fee (until they remarry). They must apply and show the veteran was eligible and they are the spouse. This is under ILCS 5/3-609 as amended. So, another thing to note for your family.

Finally, at 100% you might find a sense of closure in dealing with the VA. But remember to keep up with changes: benefits evolve (for instance, new programs for caregivers, or future tax laws). Stay in touch with your County VAC or veteran service officer yearly to review if any new state benefit or local incentive has been launched for 100% vets. For example, some counties might start a program to reimburse some portion of veteran’s surviving spouse property taxes (in addition to the exemption).

**Local Community Recognition:** At 100% in the Scott AFB region, you might be honored in community events. Organizations like the local Rotary or county veterans commission may invite you to speak or attend ceremonies. It’s not a tangible benefit, but it’s a sign of the appreciation and respect the community has. Accept these honors – you earned them.
